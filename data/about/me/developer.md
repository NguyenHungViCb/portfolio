I have recently been working a lot with [React](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)) and [ nodejs ]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js") and learning about tools and technology correlated with them.

I also do a lot of OOP through creating desktop applications using [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) and building websites using [ASP.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET)
