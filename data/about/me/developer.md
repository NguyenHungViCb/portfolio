- I first knew about programming in grade 10 and tried to learn c by myself even though I didn't have a computer and quit at "pointer." (It was too hard for me at that time, and I had an essential exam to prepare)
- Start again with c# at college, now with a computer. Polishing my oop programming skills by building some desktop and a bunch of console applications.
- I decided to learn "react" without any javascript knowledge, but I managed to learn it along the way.
Now I use "react" and node for most of my projects, but I plan to extend my skill in 2022.
